# tshock-haunt
 Makes it easier to spectate by adding a command which allows dead players (ghosts) to teleport to other players

 ***

Usage: `/haunt <player name>`

Note: `<player name>` can just be the first couple letters of the players name

For example, to haunt a player named onusai you can type `/haunt onusai` or `/haunt onu` or `/haunt o`

Player must be dead and a ghost in order to use command

By default, players are only allowed to haunt their team members

If you want players to be able to haunt other teams, edit the config file `tshock/Haunt.json` and set `OnlyAllowIfOnTeam` to `false`
